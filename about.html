						<h4 class="heading">Breast-Feeding</h4>
						Breastfeeding is the feeding of an infant with breast milk which is direct from femal human breasts rather than using infant formula from a baby bottle or some other container.
According to experts, children should be breastfed wiithin one hour of birth, exclusively breastfed for the first six months and then breastfed until age of two. Apart from that, 
those babies should also be provided with age-appropriate, nutritionally adequate foods. Under modern health care, human breast milk is considered the healthiest form of milk for 
babies. Breastfeeding promotes health for both mother and infants and helps to prevent disease. Longer breastfeeding has also been associated with better mental health through 
childhood and into adolescence.

						<h4 class="heading">Benefits of Breast Milk </h4>
	Breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for infants. It has the perfect mix of vitamins, proteins and fats which are required by the infant to grow. These all nutrients are provided
in an easily digestible form. Breast milk contains antibodies which help baby fight off viruses and bacteria. Breastfeeding reduces baby's risk of having asthma or allergies. Babies who
are breastfed exclusively for the first six months have very fewer ear infections, respiratory illnesses. They have also fewer hospitalisations and doctor trips. Breastfeeding is also 
linked to higher IQ in later childhood. Breastfed infants are more likely to gain right amount of weight as they grow rather than become overweight children.

						<h4 class="heading">Benefits For Mother</h4>
						Breastfeeding burn extra calories so it can help mother to lose pregnancy weight faster. Breastfeeding reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Since neither the measurement 
formula is required nor the nipples or warm bottles, breastfeeding helps in saving time and energy. Deciding to breastfeed provides mother with regular time for relaxing quitely with
newborn as she grows close and emotionally bonded with her infant.

						<h4 class="heading">WHO Recommendations on Breast-Feeding</h4>
	According to WHO, national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice should be promoted and supported by their maternal and child health services to avoid 
HIV infection tranmission from mother to child. The vast majority of mothers can and should breastfeed, just as the vast majority of infants can and should be breastfed. Only under 
exceptional circumstances can a mother's milk be considered unsuitable for her infant. For those few health situations where infants can't, or should not, be breastfed, the choice 
of the best alternative-expressed breast mik from an infant's own mother, breast milk from a healthy wet-nurse or a human-milk bank, or a breast-milk substitute fed with a cup, which
is a safer method than a feeding bottle and teat-depends on indidvidual circumstances. The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the six months of life, after which "infants 
should recieve nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues up to two years of age or beyond."

						<h4 class="heading">About this Initiative </h4>
	Breast Feeding is prerequisite for infants. Indian government do not have a proper data collection to know whether mothers are initiating breast-feeds in first hour of life after birth and continuing it for at least six months. It is an Indian Government initiative in collaboration with Institute Of Informatics and Communication (I.I.C.), Delhi University. The purpose of this initiative is to help government collect the data by building up a software based module, so that doctor, nurse, mother or relative will give information about breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods. The data thus collected will be further analysed for providing better health facilities in India.
